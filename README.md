## What does Best Buy Products Scraper do?

Our free Best Buy product data scraper allows you to scrape product information from one of the most popular consumer electronics retailers: [bestbuy.com](https://www.bestbuy.com/)

Best Buy Products Scraper lets you extract data on: 

- Product categories
- Product names
- URLs
- Current prices
- Original prices
- Sales
- Ratings
- Availability

You can certainly use the official Best Buy API to download product information from Best Buy. But getting comprehensive data in machine-readable format is a little tricky, especially at scale, as there are limits to how much Best Buy product data you can get. Our Best Buy Products Scraper lets you overcome these limitations. 

## How much will it cost me to use?

Best Buy Products Scraper consumes 1 compute unit per 1,000 results. That means you will pay approx. 25 cents for 1,000 results.
